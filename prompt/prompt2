Absolutely! Here's a structured set of example prompts you can use to **demonstrate different prompting techniques**—**Zero-shot**, **Few-shot**, **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**, and **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**—along with brief explanations for each.

---

### 🧠 1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**

> **Definition:** You give the model **only the task**, with no examples or reasoning steps. It relies entirely on its pretraining to respond.

**Prompt Example:**

```
Translate the following sentence into French: "The weather is nice today."
```

---

### 🧠 2. **Few-Shot Prompting**

> **Definition:** You give the model **a few examples** to guide it on how to perform the task. This improves consistency and format.

**Prompt Example:**

```
Translate the following sentences into French:

English: "I am happy."  
French: "Je suis heureux."

English: "She likes music."  
French: "Elle aime la musique."

English: "The weather is nice today."  
French:
```

### 🧠 3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

> **Definition:** You ask the model to **explain its reasoning step by step** before arriving at an answer. This is especially helpful for **math or logic problems**.

**Prompt Example:**

```
If a train travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, how far does it go?  
Let's think step by step.
```

Expected Output:

```
If the train travels at 60 miles per hour, and it travels for 3 hours,  
then the distance is speed × time = 60 × 3 = 180 miles.  
So, the train goes 180 miles.
```

### 🧠 4. **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting**

> **Definition:** The model **generates multiple solution paths**, evaluates them, and then selects or combines the best. Useful for **complex reasoning or planning**.

**Prompt Example (simplified ToT):**

```
You are helping plan a weekend getaway. Generate 3 different options with pros and cons for each. Then pick the best one based on fun and cost.
```

Expected Output:

```
Option 1: Beach trip – Fun, relaxing, but hotel costs are high.  
Option 2: Camping – Cheap and adventurous, but weather might be bad.  
Option 3: City tour – Cultural and convenient, but can be crowded.

Best Option: City tour – Balanced in cost and fun with fewer risks.
```

---

### 🧪 Bonus Idea: Try all four styles on the **same core task**, like:

> “Come up with a new product idea for remote workers.”

And observe:

* Zero-shot: Straight idea.
* Few-shot: A few example product ideas first.
* CoT: Step-by-step creative thinking.
* ToT: Multiple ideas → pros/cons → final selection.
