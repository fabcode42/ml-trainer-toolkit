🪜 Step-by-Step Live Demo Script (English)
🟢 Step 1: Intro (say this out loud)

    “Let’s see how easy it is to build a working AI app without any coding, using Amazon PartyRock. We’ll create a simple Business Advisor that gives strategic suggestions based on a business goal or challenge.”

🟡 Step 2: Go to https://partyrock.aws

    Log in with your AWS or Amazon account.

🟢 Step 3: Click "Create an App"
🟡 Step 4: Enter your prompt in the textbox

Here’s the exact prompt to paste:

    “Create an app that asks the user to describe a business challenge or goal, and then provides three pieces of strategic advice tailored to that input. Keep the tone professional and concise.”

🟢 Step 5: Click “Generate App”

    Wait a few seconds for the app to be generated.

🟡 Step 6: Test it

    Try with:

    "We want to expand into a new international market but don’t have brand recognition."

    Show the output live. Highlight how smart and contextual it is.

🟢 Step 7: Customize (optional but powerful to show)

    Rename the app: “AI Business Advisor”

    Change the background color or add an icon (for fun / branding)

    Explain how you could add more features with natural language:

    “Add a summary at the end that recaps the advice in bullet points.”
